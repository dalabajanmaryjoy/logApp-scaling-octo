> **INSTALLATION**



{

}
 
{


    1. With the Apache Server
    Step 1: Open the web browser and go to the link: https://www.phpmyadmin.net (Fig. 01) from there. Use the direct link, or google as ‘phpMyAdmin download’ and use the first link from the results.


}


    Step 2: The phpMyAdmin application website opens up, to download the latest version of phpMyAdmin. Please note, the latest version is 5. 0. 2, as of June 2020.
 }



{

    Step 3: Click on the ‘Download’ button from the above web page , the browser will prompt a pop up as below and a quick download of the ‘phpMyAdmin-5.0.2-all-languages.zip’ ZIP file will take place.
}

{
    
   Save the file in the desired location in the computer system , and extract the contents of the file by right-clicking & selecting the ‘Extract All’ option from the list .
}

{

    Step 5: Now, as the next step, locate the ‘htdocs’ folder in the Apache files from the local memory, typically it will be in the C: (C drive). Copy the contents of the ‘phpMyAdmin’ folder  after extraction and paste the same to the Apache ‘htdocs’ folder. And then, rename the destination folder to ‘phpMyAdmin’, so as to allow the database to locate the files with the name as an indicator.
   
}

{



    Step 6. Next step is to locate the ‘php.ini-production’ file  from the PHP folder from the C: (C drive), and rename it into ‘php.ini, as below, in order to make it easy for the phpMyAdmin tool to locate it when it is run.


}

{


    Step 7: For the next step, open the ‘php.ini’ with Notepad (Fig. 10), and edit the line with extension=php_mbstring.dll to remove the semicolon in that line and save the file, as it prevents phpMyAdmin to call in the PHP functions.


}


    Step 8: The phpMyAdmin tool is ready to use now, and if required one can test the same by navigating to ‘http://localhost’ for loading the phpMyAdmin tool’s homepage.
